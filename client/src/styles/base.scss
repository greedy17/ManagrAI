// I think base.scss should be something we import into almost every component. It should have:
// - "Global" typography styles for the app, like line-height, font-family, font-size, H1 styling, etc.
// - All the variables should be imported here, so they can be used across the app.
// Alternatively, I think we could import base.scss into App.vue and make sure the styles are not scoped, but I haven't
// played around with this.
